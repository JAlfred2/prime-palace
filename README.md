# prime-palace
Web app with several alogirthms that explore prime numbers.
The primality test and prime factorization algorithms don't go much higher than 20 million for some reason.
The space between the two inputs in the primes between algorithm should be less than or equal to 100,000.
The Chebyshev Function is the natural logarithm of the product of each prime number together that is
less than or equal to the input. Doesn't go much higher than 50,000.

Please contact me with comments or suggestions! I would be open to improving my skills or learning something new.
